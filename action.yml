# **what?**
# Add a changelog yaml file when a bot creates a PR.  The new yaml file 
# will be created if none already exists on the PR when the PR has a specifed label.  Once created,
# it will be committed by a specified bot and commit will be pushed to the PR.
#
# **why?**
# Automate changelog generation for more visability with automated bot changes.

# **when?**
# Once a PR is created and it has been correctly labeled.  
#
# An exampe use is for PRs created by dependabot.  You can also manually trigger this by adding the
# specified label at any time.
#
# Assumptions
#  1. You're using changie
#  2. Your changelogs live in the default `.changes`. path, nothing custom
#  3. This action is called in the context of a PR
#  4. No changelog yaml file already exists on this PR
#  5. This PR already exists and you just need to add a commit with the changelog to it
#
# A note on tokens:
# When using the GITHUB_TOKEN, the resulting commit will not trigger another GitHub Actions
# Workflow run. This is due to limitations set by GitHub.
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow
# When you use the repository's GITHUB_TOKEN to perform tasks on behalf of the GitHub Actions
# app, events triggered by the GITHUB_TOKEN will not create a new workflow run. This prevents
# you from accidentally creating recursive workflow runs. To get around this, use a Personal
# Access Token to commit changes.
